R-R interval: The time between consecutive R-peaks of the ECG waveforms can be measured to detect irregular heartbeats, which may be indicative of CHD.

QRS complex: The shape and duration of the QRS complex can be analyzed to detect abnormalities in ventricular depolarization, which may be indicative of CHD.

P-wave morphology: The shape of the P-wave can be analyzed to detect abnormalities in atrial depolarization, which may be indicative of CHD.

Heart rate variability: The variability in heart rate can be analyzed to detect changes in fetal heart function, which may be indicative of CHD.

QT interval: The duration of the QT interval can be measured to detect abnormalities in ventricular repolarization, which may be indicative of CHD.

T-wave morphology: The shape of the T-wave can be analyzed to detect abnormalities in ventricular repolarization, which may be indicative of CHD.

ST segment: The position and shape of the ST segment can be analyzed to detect changes in myocardial perfusion, which may be indicative of CHD.

To perform EDA of these factors in fetal ECG, one can use various statistical and visualization techniques such as box plots, histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices. It is also important to preprocess the data by removing noise and artifacts, and to normalize the data before feeding it to a deep learning model.

For detecting CHD using deep learning, one can use various techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). CNNs can be used to analyze spatial patterns in the ECG signals, while RNNs can be used to capture temporal patterns. A combination of CNNs and RNNs, such as the 1D-CNN-LSTM model, can be used for detecting CHD from fetal ECG data.

It is important to note that the type of CHD detected may depend on the specific abnormalities observed in the ECG signals. Some of the common types of CHD that can be detected from fetal ECG data include:

Atrial septal defect (ASD)
Ventricular septal defect (VSD)
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)
Coarctation of the aorta (CoA)
Transposition of the great arteries (TGA)
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
